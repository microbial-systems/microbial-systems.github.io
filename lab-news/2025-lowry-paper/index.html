    <title>New Publication on 1,4-dioxane bioremediation at the Lowry Landfill | Microbial Systems</title>

    <meta name="description" content="The Lowry Landfill is an EPA Superfund site that operates a very unique microbial solution to cleaning up contaminated groundwater.  The Biological Treatment System uses natural microbes to degrade 1,4-dioxane, and is a system that is pretty much unique in the US.  Thanks in large part to the hard work of Jessie Romero, MS, we have a new publication out that gets us closer to a mechanistic understanding of how the system works, thanks to shotgun metagenomics and marker gene sequencing.  In addition to data generated and analyzed by Jessie and the rest of the co-authors, this work also includes data generated by our first year General Biology students here at CU Denver!
