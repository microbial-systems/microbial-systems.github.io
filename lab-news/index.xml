      <description>Annarose Phelps has won 3rd place in the &amp;ldquo;Natural &amp;amp; Physical Sciences&amp;rdquo; category for her RaCAS 2020 poster. Congratulations, Annarose!
https://sites.google.com/view/racas2020/award-winners#h.7tdk6gaxirky
Annarose and Kayla both put together very nice posters and presentations to represent our work at the CU Denver Research and Creativer Activities Symposium. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to be able to present our work in person right now, but both Annarose and Kayla represented our labs and their science well.</description>

      <title>New publication utilizing metagenomic data for understanding the evolution of translation</title>
      <link>https://microbial.systems/lab-news/ef-2-pub/</link>

      <description>Complex evolutionary history of translation Elongation Factor 2 and diphthamide biosynthesis in Archaea and parabasalids
This is the product of a great collaboration with some excellent labs and people.
Diphthamide is a modified histidine residue which is uniquely present in archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), an essential GTPase responsible for catalyzing the coordinated translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. In part due to the role of diphthamide in maintaining translational fidelity, it was previously assumed that diphthamide biosynthesis genes (dph) are conserved across all eukaryotes and archaea.</description>

      <description>Our Old Woman Creek Wetlands team has a new publication out revealing that much of the methane in this wetland appears to come from a novel methanogen residing in surface, oxygenated soils. Congratulations and thanks to the Wrighton and Bohrer labs, who led this work.
Angle, J.C., Morin, T.H., Solden, L.M., Narrowe, A.B., Smith, G.J., Borton, M.A., Rey-Sanchez, C., Daly, R.A., Mirfenderesgi, G., Hoyt, D.W., Riley, W.J., Miller, C.S., Bohrer, G.</description>
