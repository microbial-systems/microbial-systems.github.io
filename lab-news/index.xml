      <description>We are happy to share that we have been funded as part of the initial round of awardees for the CU Denver Presidential Initiative on Urban and Place-Based Research. Our project is a collaboration with Timberley Roane at CU Denver. The work will provide a genome-resolved mechanistic understanding of the biochemical metabolisms and microbial community ecosystem interactions that are responsible for 1,4-dioxane remediation at the Lowry Landfill bioremediation plant. This site in metro Denver is an important success story for bioremediation, and we hope to gain a mechanistic understanding of this success that improves site management and offers actionable insights for similar sites around the country.</description>

      <title>New publication utilizing metagenomic data for understanding the evolution of translation</title>
      <link>https://microbial.systems/lab-news/ef-2-pub/</link>

      <description>Complex evolutionary history of translation Elongation Factor 2 and diphthamide biosynthesis in Archaea and parabasalids
This is the product of a great collaboration with some excellent labs and people.
Diphthamide is a modified histidine residue which is uniquely present in archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), an essential GTPase responsible for catalyzing the coordinated translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. In part due to the role of diphthamide in maintaining translational fidelity, it was previously assumed that diphthamide biosynthesis genes (dph) are conserved across all eukaryotes and archaea.</description>
