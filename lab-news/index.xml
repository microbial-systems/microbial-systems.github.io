      <title>New publication utilizing metagenomic data for understanding the evolution of translation</title>

      <description>Complex evolutionary history of translation Elongation Factor 2 and diphthamide biosynthesis in Archaea and parabasalids
This is the product of a great collaboration with some excellent labs and people.
Diphthamide is a modified histidine residue which is uniquely present in archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EF-2), an essential GTPase responsible for catalyzing the coordinated translocation of tRNA and mRNA through the ribosome. In part due to the role of diphthamide in maintaining translational fidelity, it was previously assumed that diphthamide biosynthesis genes (dph) are conserved across all eukaryotes and archaea.</description>

      <description>The lab feels like it’s emptying out, with 1 PhD, 1 MS, and 2 BS graduates this May. Congratulations to: Dr. Adrienne Narrowe, PhD (with both the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Department of Integrative Biology outstanding Defense awards) David Banks-Richardson, MS Biology Maria Nikulkova, BS Biology Connor Jacobs, BS Biology
A great accomplishment for each of them, and the whole lab can’t wait to see what each accomplishes next.</description>

      <description>Our Old Woman Creek Wetlands team has a new publication out revealing that much of the methane in this wetland appears to come from a novel methanogen residing in surface, oxygenated soils. Congratulations and thanks to the Wrighton and Bohrer labs, who led this work.
Angle, J.C., Morin, T.H., Solden, L.M., Narrowe, A.B., Smith, G.J., Borton, M.A., Rey-Sanchez, C., Daly, R.A., Mirfenderesgi, G., Hoyt, D.W., Riley, W.J., Miller, C.S., Bohrer, G.</description>
