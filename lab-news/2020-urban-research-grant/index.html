    <meta name="description" content="We are happy to share that we have been funded as part of the initial round of awardees for the CU Denver Presidential Initiative on Urban and Place-Based Research.  Our project is a collaboration with Timberley Roane at CU Denver.  The work will provide a genome-resolved mechanistic understanding of the biochemical metabolisms and microbial community ecosystem interactions that are responsible for 1,4-dioxane remediation at the Lowry Landfill bioremediation plant.  This site in metro Denver is an important success story for bioremediation, and we hope to gain a mechanistic understanding of this success that improves site management and offers actionable insights for similar sites around the country.">
